Plan: Identifying High-Level Approaches Prompts
-List 2-4 methods for solving this problem. Describe each method in a very brief sentence that gives a high-level gist of the approach, with no implementation details. Start with simple, brute-force iterative (if it exists), then increase in efficiency.
-Expand the first approach into a few high-level bullets, don’t share code.
-Demo that plan using a simple example, don’t share code.
-Recommend an approach, and defend your rationale.

More Detailed Plan:
-Expand approach #1  and describe an implementation in simple English steps, no variables or pseudocode.
-I don't understand step 2, please elaborate.
-How would I implement step 3 in Python? Only include code snippets around that step.
